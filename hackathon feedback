Rabbit Hop game.
I love everything about this game and let me explain!
The simplicity of the UI and the nice background reminding me of simpler maplestory times.
The functionality works and the game is fun!
Your DRY code is great, no repetetivness.
I like how you used helper functions and imported them where you needed them, makes better and orginised code.
Your comments also help understand the code very clearly.
Excellent Job all over !
