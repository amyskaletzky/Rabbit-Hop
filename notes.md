# moving rabbit
need to addeventlisteners to doc for 'up', 'space' + 'mousedown' -> to jump
use keyframes 'hop' to set height of hop
animation: hop 0.3s linear (can change s) -> inside .hop class -> which is added to rabbit, whenever
eventlistener

setTimer -> around 300/500ms to remove classlist hop

add if statement to hop() 



# move ground
need to use setInterval(), maybe use two imgs like the yt vid, read more
move a certain amount per ms? (test)

# create ground
width -> screen.width on js to find screen size + set
ground.style.width = screensize  


# game ends if run into/ land on cactus
check where cactus position is on the page + width
if rabbit position <  && > to cactus position + width

# gameover 
function -> stop the screen + add transparent modal (display:none when gameover=== false)
display:block when gameover === true

# score
starts at 0 -> as soon as start game (500ms)


# sky bg
backmost layer, unnaffected by everything + slower speed 
-> later design: starry night + some gradient sunrise/set + sunny day
